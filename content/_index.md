2025 continued to fuel our excitement for MS-based Proteomics. Have a look [at the joint review](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08584-0) of T. Guo, JA Steen and M Mann on our view of exciting current technical developments and a path to further clinical applications of proteomics.

It has also been an exceptional year for the Mann Lab, with major publications in Nature, Nature Biotechnology, Nature Genetics, Nature Protocols, Nature Communications, Cancer Cell, Cell, Cell Systems, EMBO Molecular Medicine, and Molecular Cell among others. Our work continues to advance mass spectrometry-based proteomics technology while translating these capabilities into clinical and biological applications.
